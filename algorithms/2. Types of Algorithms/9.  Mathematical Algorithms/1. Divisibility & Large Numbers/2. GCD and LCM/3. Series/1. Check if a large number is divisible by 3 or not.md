Calculating 𝑥(n)(Power Function)
The problem of calculating 
𝑥(n)(x raised to the power n) can be solved efficiently using various methods, including iterative and recursive approaches. One of the most efficient methods is the Exponentiation by Squaring method, which reduces the time complexity significantly.

Exponentiation by Squaring
The idea behind this method is to reduce the number of multiplications needed to compute 
𝑥(n). The approach involves:
If n is even: 𝑥(n) =(𝑥(n/2))2

 
If n is odd: 𝑥(n)=(x* 𝑥(n-1))  
By recursively or iteratively applying these rules, we can compute 𝑥(n) = 𝑂(log𝑛) time.

Recursive Approach
Here’s a Python implementation using the recursive approach for exponentiation by squaring:

def pow_recursive(x, n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n < 0:
        return 1 / pow_recursive(x, -n)
    elif n % 2:
        return x * pow_recursive(x, n - 1)
    else:
        half = pow_recursive(x, n // 2)
        return half * half

# Example usage
x = 2.0
n = 10
result = pow_recursive(x, n)
print(result)  # Output: 1024.0
Explanation
Base case: If n is 0, x(0) = 1.
Negative power: If n is negative, 𝑥(−𝑛) = 1/𝑥(n).
Odd power: If n is odd, 𝑥(n) = 𝑥*𝑥(n-1).
Even power: If n is even, 𝑥(n) = (𝑥(n/2))2.

Iterative Approach
The same idea can be implemented iteratively to avoid the overhead of recursion:

def pow_iterative(x, n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if n < 0:
        x = 1 / x
        n = -n
    result = 1
    current_product = x
    while n > 0:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            result *= current_product
        current_product *= current_product
        n //= 2
    return result

# Example usage
x = 2.0
n = 10
result = pow_iterative(x, n)
print(result)  # Output: 1024.0


Explanation
Handle zero and negative powers: If n is 0, return 1. If n is negative, invert 
x and make n positive.

Iterative computation:
Initialize result to 1 and current_product to x
For each bit in the binary representation of n:
If the current bit is 1, multiply result by current_product.
Square current_product for the next bit.
Right shift n by 1 (equivalent to integer division by 2).

Conclusion
Both the recursive and iterative methods efficiently calculate 
𝑥(n) using the principle of exponentiation by squaring, reducing the time complexity to O(logn). The iterative method may be preferred in environments where recursion depth is a concern.
